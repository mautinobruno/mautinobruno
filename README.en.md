Hi, I'm Bruno Mautino. I am a Software Engineering student at [UNITEC](https://www.unitec.mx/) interested in anything that has numbers involved. I was born in Araucanía, Chile but now I am living in Tlaxcala, México. 🌎

I program mainly in PHP because it is the language that interests me the most and most of the software of sites that I usually work with use that language, but soon I will learn more to increase my job opportunities. 💻

You can contact me in the links that I leave below, I speak Spanish **[es-MX]**, English **[en-US]** and Simplified Chinese **[zh-CN]**. But I am always interested in learning other languages to communicate better.. 💬

My hobbies are reading books, especially about religion and metaphysics, meditating and jogging. Although I am interested in other things such as technology, computers and mathematics. 📘
